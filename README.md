#FARMIUM TOKEN
1. Introduction
•About Us
Farmium is a DeFi project whose primary objective is to maximize profits for its users majorly through asset staking and yeild farming. In comparison to Harvest, Farmium uses an automatic and algorithmic model similar to Pancakeswap to ensure returns and achieve low slippage. 

One thing that all blockchains have in common is that transactions must be confirmed.
Bitcoin, for example, accomplishes this through a process known as mining, which is known to consume a significant amount of electricity (Proof-of-Work).
Other consensus processes, on the other hand, are utilized for validation.
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is one such consensus mechanism that comes in a variety of flavors as well as hybrid models.
All of them will be referred to as staking to make things simple.
FARMIUM staking platform offers token holders some network decision-making power. By staking Farmium tokens, You simply obtain the capacity to vote and earn BNB.
It works in a similar way to receiving interest for keeping money in a bank account or sending it to the bank to invest. 
In otherwords, Farmium, the world's leading yield farm aggregator, aims to provide the highest annual percentage yield (APY) to its community.
